\acknowledgements
I would like to thank my beautiful family and friends. Especially to my dad, Charles, who always advised me and took care of all boring stuff in my life, so I could have time to concentrate; My mom, Eneida, who is a super mother, always worked insanely long periods and still have time to take care, cook and groom us; My sister, Debóra,  who had to handle my hugs and rants every half hour during my academic life. I truly love them and appreciate all the support they have given me. I would also like to express l my gratitude for my girlfriend, Bruna, for having an endless patience, and offering me a warm shoulder during my entire journey.

I would like to thanks Dr. Eduardo Almeida. He was the first professor to believe in my capacity, never gave up on me and kept me on the academic track during my times of doubt. He is someone who I truly admire and always been an inspirational figure for me. I also want to show all my gratitude to Dr. Cássio Prazeres for being an amazing advisor and for always being there during my graduation.

Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to Tassio Vale, my co-advisor, who pushed me to work, patiently revised my thesis multiple times and pointed me the way during the thesis writing.
